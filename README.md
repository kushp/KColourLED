# KColourLED
This was a BlackBerry App I worked on before BB10 released (I think Android was small at that time too). It was meant to set different LED colours for different notifications.

It was really a way for me to just pick up the BlackBerry SDK and discover for myself what is possible! I was able to quickly learn a lot by just peeking through the API and the JavaDocs. Doing is one of the best ways of learning.
